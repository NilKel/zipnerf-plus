# Confidence Field Learning Rate Multiplier Configuration
# Uses multiplier approach for easier experimentation

# Use multiplier to scale main learning rate for confidence field
# Set to 2.0 for 2x higher confidence LR, 0.5 for 2x lower, etc.
Config.confidence_lr_multiplier = 2.0  # 2x higher than main model

# Update experiment name to reflect configuration
